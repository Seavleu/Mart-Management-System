# Mart-Management-System
This is my school project, but I am well aware that this system is not fully usable yet.
However, I am working on improving it.


**Software:** Microsoft Access 
**Language?** Some VB and Macro will expected to see there 
**Principle?** Normalizatin principle (1NF, 2NF, 3NFM), Database designing principle

**What to focus?** Form, Table, Query, and Relationship Manipulation. As long as you understanding the properties, table relation, and code I used in each form you will be able to easily manipulate the form based on your preference. 

**Note:** Make sure to always re-check datatype and Filename between tables that have relationships with each others!
