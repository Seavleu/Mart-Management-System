# Mart Management System School Project - Instructions

Welcome to the Mart Management System project! This system is built using Microsoft Access and incorporates some VB (Visual Basic) and Macro elements. The project aims to manage various aspects of a mart or store, such as products, inventory, sales, and customers. Although the system might not be fully functional yet, you can contribute to its improvement and gain experience in database design and manipulation.

## Principles to Focus on:

- **Normalization Principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF):** Ensure that the database design follows normalization principles to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity. Review the tables and make necessary adjustments to achieve higher normalization levels.

- **Database Designing Principle:** Pay attention to the overall design of the database. Review the tables' structure and relationships to ensure they accurately represent the real-world entities and their associations.

## Areas of Focus:

- **Form Manipulation:** Review and improve the existing forms used in the system. Ensure they are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and provide a smooth user experience. Feel free to modify the layout, add validation, or enhance functionalities as needed.

- **Table Manipulation:** Examine the tables used in the system. Check the data types and ensure consistency and accuracy in the data stored. If required, modify the table structures to better align with the needs of the mart management system.

- **Query Manipulation:** Inspect the existing queries and enhance them to provide useful information and insights for the mart management. You can create new queries to generate reports, track sales, or analyze inventory.

- **Relationship Manipulation:** Examine the relationships between tables and ensure they accurately represent the associations between various entities. Modify or establish new relationships where needed.

## Instructions for Improving the System:

- **Review Code and Logic:** Examine the VB and Macro elements used in the system. Ensure the code is well-organized, easy to understand, and follows best practices. Make necessary modifications to improve functionality and efficiency.

- **Add Missing Features:** Identify any crucial features that might be missing in the system and work on incorporating them. Examples could be sales reports, customer management, or notifications for low inventory.

- **Testing and Debugging:** Thoroughly test the system to identify and fix any bugs or errors. Verify that the data is correctly entered, stored, and retrieved from the database.

- **User Interface Enhancement:** Focus on the user interface and design a visually appealing and intuitive interface. Ensure that users can easily navigate the system and perform tasks efficiently.

- **Documentation:** Document the changes you make, the improvements you introduce, and any new features you add. This documentation will be valuable for future users and developers.

**Note:** As you work on the project, always double-check data types and filenames for tables with relationships to maintain data consistency and avoid errors.
