# Mart-Management-System
This is my school project, but I am well aware that this system is not fully usable yet.
However, I am working on improving it.


Software: Microsoft Access 
Language? Some VB and Macro will expected to see there 
Principle? Normalizatin principle (1NF, 2NF, 3NFM), Database designing principle

What to focus? Form, Table, Query, and Relationship Manipulation. As long as you understanding the property and the code I used in each form you will be able to easily manipulate the form based on your preference. 

Note: Make sure to always re-check datatype and Filename between tables that have relationships with each others!
